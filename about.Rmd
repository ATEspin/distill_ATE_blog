**Bio**

I was born in Mataró, a city close to Barcelona in Spain. I studied biology at the Universitat de Barcelona from 2002 to 2007. With interest in neuroscience, I began my PhD in 2008 at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona under the supervision of Dr. Xavier Navarro. I moved to Canada in 2014 for a postdoctoral position at the University of Alberta in Edmonton under the supervision of Dr. Karim Fouad. Here, I worked on the interaction between neuroinflammation and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. From November 2018 to 2020, I worked at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in a team led by Dr. Adam Ferguson, on the application of data science to accelerate neurological research and translation. In 2020, I was hired at UCSF as an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery. Since August 2023 I hold an Assistant Professor position at the University of Waterloo in Canada.

**Research interest**

My broad work is in the application of data science methods to health research. I am interested in conceptualizing health and disease as complex multi-domain (e.g., biological, medical, psychological, social, technological), multi-level (e.g., molecular, individual, and population), and dynamic process. I focus on applying health data science, and machine learning solutions, integrating diverse data resources to answer health-related questions and inform practice. With increasing health and healthcare challenges, the growing availability of digital health data provides unprecedented opportunities to study this complexity and inform precise evidence-based practice and policies. My research has focused on the health context of complex heterogeneous population such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, dementia, and chronic low back pain, resulting in tremendous individual and societal costs. I am also interested in analytical and computational methods, multivariate statistics, the reproducibility and replicability of research, and real-world evidence.
