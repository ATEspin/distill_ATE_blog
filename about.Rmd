**Research Associate, University of Alberta, Edmonton**
**Assistant Adjunct Professor, University of California San Francisco**

I was born in Mataro, a city close to Barcelona in Spain. I studied biology at the Universitat de Barcelona from 2002 to 2007. With interest in neuroscience, I began my PhD in 2008 at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona under the supervision of Dr. Xavier Navarro (check my thesis here). I moved to Canada in 2014 for a postdoctoral position at the University of Alberta in Edmonton under the supervision of Dr. Karim Fouad. Here, I worked on the interaction between neuroinflammation and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. From November 2018 to 2020, I worked at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in a team led by Dr. Adam Ferguson, on the application of data science to accelerate neurotrauma research and translation. In 2020, I was hired at UCSF as an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery. I currently hold a Research Associate position at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.
