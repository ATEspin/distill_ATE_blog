*"Life is a causal latent space"*

At health.data DRIVEN Lab we apply data-driven approaches for health and biomedical data **Discovery** and  **Research** through the use of **Informatics**, **Visualization**, data **Exploration**, and **Networks**. 

We are academic data scientist aiming to increase the value of health data and biomedical research through the application of data science methods and informatics. We are interested in the conceptualization and computational modeling of health and disease as complex systems, systems thinking in health, precision health, the reuse of data to gain insights, multidimensional analytics, applied health data science, and research reproducibility and data sharing.
