At data DRIVEN we embrace data **Discovery** and advocate for **Reproducibility** through the use of **Informatics**, **Visualization** and data **Exploration** for **Neuroscience** research. 

We are academic data scientist aiming to increase the value of biomedical and neuroscience research through the application of data science and bioinformatics. We are interested in reproducibility, data reuse, data sharing, multidimensional analytics and applied machine learning. We perform computational studies that reuse data and we collaborate on biomedical research which requires the application of data science. We also contribute to building data sharing infrastructures and creating informatic tools.
